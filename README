--- Currently only compatible with Cake v1.3 ---

The Prowl plugin requires the following to get started:

-config/prowl.php
-- OPTIONAL: input your Prowl API key (the API key is a unique identifier which is used to send push notifications to a device; it can also be used as a developer API key but is optional)

In your models that you wish to use Prowl, add it to the $uses array:
	var $uses = array('Prowl.Prowl');

Creating a push notification is as simple as the following:
	$this->Prowl->create();
	if (! $this->Prowl->save($data)) {
		//print or log error
	}

An example shell task is provided to see one possible use of this plugin. Other uses might be to alert web-users of certain actions, such as:
 - balance due
 - new reply to your forum post
 - approve/comment (administration)
 - new activity in helpdesk support ticket

You are only limited to your imagination and the capabilities of Prowl itself.
